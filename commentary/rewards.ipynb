    "Super Mario Brothers (1985) includes an explicit scoring system. It is interesting that this scoring system does not inform the reward function at all, unlike in the Atari context, where the point scoring was the reward.\n",

    "For a fuller description of the point mechanism details see [Super Mario Wiki - Point](https://www.mariowiki.com/Point#Super_Mario_series).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Super Mario Bros., Mario can earn points by interacting with the environment in various ways. For instance, he earns 50 points for breaking Bricks, 200 for collecting a coin, and 1,000 for collecting a power-up. Points can also be earned upon defeating an enemy, with higher points earned for sequences of defeated enemies without landing back on the ground. ... At the end of each stage, pulling down the flag on the flagpole grants 100, 400, 800, 2,000, or 5,000 points depending on how high the flagpole is touched. At the end of a level, there is a bonus that grants 50 points for each remaining second on the timer, though no such bonus is present in castle levels in the original NES version. ... In many games, points are largely aesthetic and serve only as a secondary goal ...\n",

    "---\n",

    "Looking at a [decompilation](https://gist.github.com/1wErt3r/4048722) would be an approach to fully explore the point system.\n",

    "> Title: What purpose did the original scoring system in Super Mario Bros. serve?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ... Immediately before the NES was Atari, which (mostly) tried to emulate the experience of arcade games at the time. And arcade games were almost all scoring based. ... This was also an early form of creating visual and tactile feedback to give players a greater sense of satisfaction. These big numbers are specifically important in SMB when you ride down the pole and the numbers are \"rung up\". More points+faster time means a longer timing counting your score.
